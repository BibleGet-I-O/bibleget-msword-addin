This project is released as open source, in the hopes that others might collaborate on the project, or that what I have not succeeded in accomplishing might be picked up again by someone else and made to be of better service to mankind.

This plugin facilitates inserting Bible quotes into your documents.

It communicates with the [BibleGet I/O service endpoint](https://query.bibleget.io) for retrieval of Bible quotes.

You can set your preferred text formatting for the Bible quotes so that you don't have to format them manually every time you insert them into your document.
