**Installation Package** https://www.bibleget.io/applications/microsoft-word-macro/

In order to install the plugin, download the most recent installation package from the link here above. Click once on the blue package button to download the package. (If for any reason the download doesn't start, try right-clicking on the package button and choose "save to file" or similar from the context menu.) Once downloaded either choose "Execute" from the notification at the bottom of the browser window (MS Explorer or Edge), or click on the downloaded file at the bottom of the browser window (Chrome), or go to your browser downloads (Firefox) and click on the downloaded package from there.

The installation process will launch and will probably take a few minutes, a few Microsoft components need to be downloaded and installed in order for the plugin to work. You may be requested to restart your computer in the process, if that is the case the installation will pick up again and complete after the restart. Once the installation has completed, every time you open Microsoft Word you’ll see a new menu “BibleGet I/O” with it’s own ribbon area. The icon buttons on the ribbon area allow you to set preferences for text formatting of the Bible quotes, see information about the plugin and renew data from the BibleGet server (such as supported Bible Versions, and Languages for the Books of the Bible that the BibleGet server can understand), get instructions for formulating Bible Quotes and using the Add-In, send donations or feedback. There are two ways of inserting Bible quotes into your document: by opening a dialog window where you can choose the Bible versions to quote from and type in your desired quote, or by writing the desired quote directly in your document and selecting it and clicking on the relative icon button. There are keyboard shortcuts for the icon buttons on the ribbon, when you press “ALT” you can see a hint. “ALT+q” is the shortcut for the BibleGet menu, which can then be continued for the single icon items.

This project is released as open source, in the hopes that others might collaborate on the project, or that what I have not succeeded in accomplishing might be picked up again by someone else and made to be of better service to mankind.

This plugin facilitates inserting Bible quotes into your documents.

It communicates with the [BibleGet I/O service endpoint](https://query.bibleget.io) for retrieval of Bible quotes.

You can set your preferred text formatting for the Bible quotes so that you don't have to format them manually every time you insert them into your document.
